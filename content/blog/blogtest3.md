summary: "This is the first recipe I've developed! I love cookies and tea-flavored things but have not seen many hojicha baked goods. This cookie is light, crisp, and not too sweet. Perfect with tea."

## Ingredients

* 1/2 cup (1 stick) unsalted butter - browned and chilled to bring back to room temp
* 1 large egg (room temp)
* 200 g AP flour
* 95 g sugar
* 2 tablespoons toasted and ground hojicha tea leaves
* 1tablespoon water (to accommodate for browned butter loss)

## Method
1. Brown the butter; make sure to do this ahead of time as it needs to come back to room temp/resolidify
2. Toast tea leaves in a dry pan over medium heat until fragrant - couple minutes
3. Grind tea leaves into a powder using a spice grinder
4. Cream butter and sugar together until light and fluffy (2-3 minutes)
5. Add egg into butter and sugar mixture and beat until well combined
6. Add flour and ground tea and mix until just incorporated
7. Transfer dough onto sheet of plastic, wrap and refrigerate until firm but still workable
8. Shape into a log approximately 1.5 inches in diameter and rewrap in plastic
9. Refrigerate or freeze until very firm (~1 hour)
10. Heat oven to 350 degrees
11. Bake cookies on a lined baking sheet for 12-15 minute, until cookies are set and golden brown
