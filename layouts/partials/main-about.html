            <p>This is a website I built for myself during my free time outside work - mostly as a way to learn some web
                design and mess around with techniques I'm curious about. I've always been interested in
                "scrollytelling", and as such, my site incorporates a lot of scrolling events and the like. </p>
            <p>I didn't want my "About Me" to be an endless rant about my entire life story displayed in a wall of text,
                so I built a little visual aid...</p>

                        I grew up in a suburb outside of Los Angeles called Chino Hills. I attended kindergarten through
                        high school here.

                        After graduating from high school, I didn't go very far to attend college. I moved to Claremont, CA
                        - a mere twenty minute drive from my hometown - and attended Scripps College.
                        <br>
                        I graduated in May, 2015 with a B.A. in Computational Neuroscience.

                        During my time at Scripps, I worked as a Research Assistant for the Decision Neuroscience Lab at
                        Claremont McKenna College. It was here that I was exposed to electroencephalography and data
                        analysis on brain wave data. My senior thesis was titled "Time-Frequency Analysis of Neural
                        Oscillations in Multi-Attribute Decision Making".

                        I moved to San Francisco soon after graduating from Scripps and began my first job at SOASTA working

                        2018, I left Akamai and joined conDati.

                        2018. We're still living here now, and spend our free time exploring all nature has to offer! I also
                        picked up wheelthrowing and continue to knit, practice yoga, cook, and explore the new city.
