            <p>This is a website I built for myself during my free time outside work - mostly as a way to learn some web
                design and mess around with techniques I'm curious about. I've always been interested in
                "scrollytelling" so my site incorporates a lot of scrolling events. </p>
            <p>I didn't want my "About Me" to be an endless rant about my entire life story displayed in a wall of text,
                so I built a little visual aid...</p>

                        picked up wheelthrowing and continue to knit, practice yoga, cook, and explore the new city.

                When I'm not working, I prefer to spend my time cooking/eating/baking (I ‚ô•Ô∏è food!), traveling/exploring, or
                playing piano. As a kid, my parents made sure my sister and I were well-travelled and willing to try
                new foods, experiences, and cultures.

                I have very fond memories of vacations to the Hawaiian Islands, Canc√∫n, Bah√≠a de los √Ångeles, Taiwan, and many national parks.

                I consider myself extremely lucky to be living in the Pacific Northwest. It is an amazing place with an abundance of nature to explore, food to eat, and things to do. Since moving here I have been able to go clamming, mushroom foraging, skiing, climbing, hiking, kayaking... something for every season!
