				<p>Thanks for visiting my page! This is a personal website for me to mess around with stuff and for you to get to know me a little! Everything on here is a work in progress, so please don't be surprised (or appalled) if bits and pieces are buggy.</p>
				<p>I built and designed everything on this site and had a lot of fun doing it. Hope you enjoy scrolling through.</p>
				<p>Who knows, one day I may turn this into a blog; keep an eye out! ‚úåüèΩ</p>

				<p>This is a website I built for myself during my free time outside work - mostly as a way to learn some web design and mess around with techniques I'm curious about. I've always been interested in "scrollytelling", and as such, my site incorporates a lot of scrolling events and the like. </p>
				<p>I didn't want my "About Me" to be an endless rant about my entire life story displayed in a wall of text, so I built a little visual aid...</p>

						I grew up in a suburb outside of Los Angeles called Chino Hills. I attended kindergarten through high school here.

						After graduating from high school, I didn't go very far to attend college. I moved to Claremont, CA - a mere twenty minute drive from my hometown - and attended Scripps College.
						<br>
						I graduated in May, 2015 with a B.A. in Computational Neuroscience.
						<br><br>
						During my time at Scripps, I worked as a Research Assistant for the Decision Neuroscience Lab at Claremont McKenna College. It was here that I was exposed to electroencephalography and data analysis on brain wave data. My senior thesis was titled "Time-Frequency Analysis of Neural Oscillations in Multi-Attribute Decision Making".

						I moved to San Francisco soon after graduating from Scripps and began my first job at SOASTA working as a Data Scientist. A few years after I joined the company, Akamai acquired SOASTA. In spring of 2018, I left Akamai and joined conDati.

We're still living here now, and spend our free time exploring all nature has to offer! I also picked up wheelthrowing and continue to knit, practice yoga, cook, and explore the new city.
